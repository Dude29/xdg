#
#  The /etc/xdg/user-dirs.conf file is a text file that controls the behavior of the
#  xdg-user-dirs-update command. Users can have their own ~/.config/user-dirs.conf file,
#  which overrides the system-wide configuration.
#
#  The following keys are recognised:
#    - enabled (boolean)
#    - filename_encoding (encoding name)
#

# When set to False, xdg-user-dirs-update will not change the XDG user dirs
# configuration.
enabled=true

# This sets the filename encoding to use. encoding may be an explicit encoding name,
# such as UTF-8, or "locale", which means the encoding of the users locale will be used.
filename_encoding='UTF-8'

# Lines beginning with a # character are ignored.
